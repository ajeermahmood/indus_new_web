                    <b>Affordability:</b> Understanding your financial
                    capabilities is crucial before embarking on a real estate
                    purchase. INDUS REAL ESTATE recommends that your monthly
                    housing expenses should not exceed 30% of your salary.
                    Additionally, consider upfront fees, which typically amount
                    to 7-8% of the purchase price. These fees include:
                  </p>
                </li>
                <ul>
                  <li className="lh-2">Dubai Land Department fee</li>
                  <li className="lh-2">Property registration fee</li>

                  INDUS REAL ESTATE can assist you in finding properties that
                  align with your budget and provide guidance on managing
                  ongoing maintenance and service fees.

                    <b>Savings:</b> Saving for a down payment is a pivotal step
                    in the home buying process. As per UAE Central Bank
                    Regulations, expats are required to provide a minimum
                    deposit of 25% for properties valued under AED 5 million,
                    while UAE nationals need to provide 20%. Your down payment
                    must come from your savings and cannot be financed through a
                    personal loan. However, other upfront transaction costs,
                    agent fees, and bank fees may be financed using a personal
                    loan, which INDUS REAL ESTATE can advise on.

                    <b>Rental Yeild:</b> For investors considering rental
                    income, it&apos;s essential to evaluate the potential rental
                    yield of the property. INDUS REAL ESTATE can help you assess
                    whether the projected rental income will cover your mortgage
                    repayments and maintenance expenses, ensuring a profitable
                    investment.

                    <b>Residence Visa:</b> Property ownership in Dubai and the
                    UAE may also offer residency visa benefits. Depending on the
                    property value, you may be eligible for a residency visa,
                    ranging from 6-month multi-entry visas to 5-year residency
                    visas. INDUS REAL ESTATE can guide you through the
                    eligibility criteria and application process for residency
                    visas, as well as sponsorship options for family members.
