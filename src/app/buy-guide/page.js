                    <b>Affordability:</b> It is advised that your monthly
                    housing expenses should not exceed 30% of your salary. When
                    buying a house it is crucial to budget the upfront fees -
                    this can be close to 7-8% of the purchase price. Upfront
                    fees include Dubai Land Department fee, property
                    registration fee, real estate agent fee, property valuation
                    fee amongst others. As an owner, you will not only have to
                    pay for the ongoing maintenance fees but also the annual
                    service fees.

                    <b>Savings:</b> Perhaps the most important factor to
                    consider when contemplating buying a home is your
                    down-payment. In line with UAE Central Bank Regulations, the
                    minimum deposit required for expats is 25% of the purchase
                    price for properties valued at less than AED 5 million, and
                    20% for UAE nationals. A personal loan obtained from a local
                    bank cannot be used to finance your down-payment â€” this must
                    come from your own savings. However, the above-mentioned
                    upfront transaction costs, agent fees and bank fees may be
                    financed using a personal loan.

                    into an investment property in the long term then it&apos;s
                    important to assess whether the projected rental income will
                    be sufficient to cover your monthly mortgage repayment and
                    maintenance expenses.

                    residency visa through home-ownership, subject to meeting
                    certain conditions. You may be eligible for 2 types of
                    visas: 6-month multi-entry or a 2-year residency. For
                    properties valued above AED 5 million: If there is no
                    mortgage attached and the property has been retained for 3
                    years, you may be entitled to a 5-year residency visa,
